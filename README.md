# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <br>I'm Kacper

I'm a computer science student interested in gamedev and UX/UI. I value the human side of software. I place the looks on the same level as performance. I enjoy a clever algorithms, neat code structures and very flashy buttons. 

Yes, I am spending too much time on CSS.

# Education

## Bachelor of Engineering in Automation and Robotics (spec. Industry 4.0)
I learned a good mixture of electronics and programming. Programming side was focussed mostly on Embedded with C/C++ but choosing to specialize in Industry 4.0 allowed me to learn some mobile app development and higher level languages like C# and Java.

## Applied Computer Science
In progress. On my 1 level studies I was most interested in the programming side. So here I am for my masters. It allowed me to learn more about web development and some more programming theory. We were using Angular and Spring Boot in our course projects one of which utilized some AWS services.

## Aditional courses I took
- Angular - The Complete Guide (2024 Edition) at Udemy
- Python Data Essentials at Pluralsight

## Experience
### Digital signal processing at Nanores
I was developing a signal processing algorithm doing research in Python and then implementing it in C++ to run on STM32.

## Projects I took part in
- Desktop WinForms app for managing factory warehouses, sales and deliveries 
- IOT plant monitoring system
- Pathfinging algorithm for RTS type game in Unity (My thesis)
- RND on AI based software vulnerability detection
- Angular app for managing cinema tickets
- Tic-tac-toe game made with Angular, Spring Boot and AWS
