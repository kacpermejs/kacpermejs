# Education

## Bachelor of Engineering in Automation and Robotics (spec. Industry 4.0)
I learned a good mixture of electronics and programming. Programming side was focussed mostly on Embedded with C/C++ but choosing to specialize in Industry 4.0 allowed me to learn some mobile app development and higher level languages like C# and Java.

## Applied Computer Science
In progress. On my first level studies I was most interested in the programming side. So here I am for my masters. It allowed me to learn more about web development and some more programming theory. We were using Angular and Spring Boot in our course projects one of which utilized some AWS services.

## Aditional courses I took
- Angular - The Complete Guide (2024 Edition) at Udemy
- Python Data Essentials at Pluralsight
